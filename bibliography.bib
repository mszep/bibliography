	abstract = "Transport in metal-molecule-metal junctions is defined by the alignment and coupling of molecular orbitals with continuum electronic states in the metal contacts. Length-dependent changes in molecular orbital alignment and coupling with contact states were probed via measurements and comparisons of thermopower (S) of a series of phenylenes and alkanes with varying binding groups. S increases linearly with length for phenylenediames and phenylenedithiols while it decreases linearly in alkanedithiols. Comparison of these data suggests that the molecular backbone determines the length dependence of S, while the binding group determines the zero length or contact S. Transport in phenylenes was dominated by the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), which aligns closer to the Fermi energy of the contacts as approximately L(-1), but becomes more decoupled from them as approximately e(-L). In contrast, the decreasing trend in S for alkanedithiols suggests that transmission is largely affected by gold-sulfur metal induced gap states residing between the HOMO and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital.",

	abstract = "Transport fluctuations and variations in a series of metal-molecule-metal junctions were quantified through measurements of their thermopower. Thiol bound aromatic molecules of various lengths and degrees of freedom were chosen to understand the magnitude and origins of the variations. Junction thermopower was determined by measuring the voltage difference across molecules trapped between two gold contacts held at different temperatures. While any given measurement was remarkably stable, the breadth of distributions from repeated measurements implies variations in the offset of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) relative to the Fermi Energy of the contacts, similar in magnitude to the nominal offset itself. Statistical analysis of data shows that these variations are born at the junction formation, increase with molecular length, and are dominated by variations in contact geometry and orbital hybridization, as well as intermolecular interactions.",

	abstract = "Building an electronic device using individual molecules is one of the ultimate goals in nanotechnology. To achieve this it will be necessary to measure, control and understand electron transport through molecules attached to electrodes. Substantial progress has been made over the past decade and we present here an overview of some of the recent advances. Topics covered include molecular wires, two-terminal switches and diodes, three-terminal transistor-like devices and hybrid devices that use various different signals (light, magnetic fields, and chemical and mechanical signals) to control electron transport in molecules. We also discuss further issues, including molecule-electrode contacts, local heating- and current-induced instabilities, stochastic fluctuations and the development of characterization tools.",

@Article{ joachimratner,
	abstract = {The field of molecular electronics comprises a fundamental set of issues concerning the electronic response of molecules as parts of a mesoscopic structure and a technology-facing area of science. We will overview some important aspects of these subfields. The most advanced ideas in the field involve the use of molecules as individual logic or memory units and are broadly based on using the quantum state space of the molecule. Current work in molecular electronics usually addresses molecular junction transport, where the molecule acts as a barrier for incoming electrons: This is the fundamental Landauer idea of "conduction as scattering" generalized to molecular junction structures. Another point of view in terms of superexchange as a guiding mechanism for coherent electron transfer through the molecular bridge is discussed. Molecules generally exhibit relatively strong vibronic coupling. The last section of this overview focuses on vibronic effects, including inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy, hysteresis in junction charge transport, and negative differential resistance in molecular transport junctions.},
